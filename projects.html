                    Pressure and Humidity can be
                    Monitered using a combination of Microcontrollers and Sensors which are Easy to use and Mobile and
                    also Cheapper than Normal Weather Station. Arduino Mega 2560, DHT11, BMP 180 are the main Components
                    used in this Project.<br><br>
                    The microcontroller based weather reporting system using Arduino supporting
                    controllers is fully automated and efficient. It does not require any manual labor or
                    attention. We can plan and visit the places anytime we like with prior notification of the
                    weather conditions. We can simply get the status of the weather condition and the air
                    quality, etc. Therefore, with the help of embedded devices and sensors, any environment
                    can be converted to a smart environment for accumulating the data and analyzing the
                    environment with real-time monitoring. Hence, with such advances on microcontroller
                    based , organizations are focusing on understanding the impact of weather on their
                    operations and finding cutting-edge analytics on how to control the impact of their
                    business.<br><br>

                    using Radar System</h2>
                <p class="skills__text" style="text-align: justify;">
                    To make an aircraft stereotype which is not detectable in sensitive arduino radar thus
                    making it efficient for stealth and surveillance purposes. The accuracy of ultrasonic sensors
                    used in arduino radar is 300khz to 3 mhz. Its range is 21.2 cm.<br><br>

                    We have designed an object with its length more than that of a sensor. We have coated
                    it with CNT and when placed in its range, the radar doesn't detect it and this application can be
                    used in future for stealth and security purposes.

                    Hence an object undetectable in radar frequency can be attained by CNT technology.
                    CNT not only has EM waves absorption/scattering property but also it makes aircrafts sinewy
                    and lighter thus improving its propulsion system. Overall it makes the aircraft economical and
                    cost effective thus stretching a gallon of gas.<br><br>

                    However, it is important to note that the use of radar systems for CNT detection is still an active
                    area of research, and there may be limitations and challenges to overcome in order to fully utilize
                    this technology.
